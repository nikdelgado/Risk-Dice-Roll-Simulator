# Risk-Dice-Roll-Simulator

This program was written for my data structures class assignment. The programis designed to be a dice rolling simulation tool for the popular board game called Risk. The intended user of the program are risk players who would like to speed up the game of lengthy battles by simulating them. The program will take the army size of both the attacker and defender and the dice number desired to be used by the user and simulate a round of battle.
